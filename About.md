The target of the application is to program a simple microcontroller to turn on the lights and monitor the temperature at a regular rate.

The main aim is to write a simple and straightforward code to be easily understood by any one, even non technical proficiencies.
The variables in the code are self explanatory and the code is well commented.

The main challenge in this application is that I am not used to using the arduino platform.
I mainly focus on programming ATmel and ARM microcontrollers.
It can be seen that my usage of arduino builtin functions is kept to minimum.
I am really experienced with the C language, I have been writing C codes for almost 4 and a half years now.
